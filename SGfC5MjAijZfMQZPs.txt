Warnings by type
== is redundant, because the left and right expressions always have the same value. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	4
- is irrelevant since the right expression is redundant. Parent's relevant type = {_} Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	5
Subset operator is redundant, because the right subexpression is always empty. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	8
<: is irrelevant because the result is always empty. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	4
This variable is unused.	54
Subset operator is redundant, because the left and right subexpressions are always disjoint. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	23
Subset operator is redundant, because both subexpressions are always empty. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	1
& is irrelevant because the two subexpressions are always disjoint. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	22
Subset operator is redundant, because the left and right expressions always have the same value. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	1
Subset operator is redundant, because the left subexpression is always empty. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	20
The join operation here always yields an empty set. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	154
The right expression of -> is irrelevant because the left expression is always empty. Left type = {_} Right type = {_}	2
